Ad Click Prediction Using Logistic Regression
# 1.Ad Click Prediction Using Logistic Regression

This project is focused on predicting whether a user will click on an advertisement based on various user attributes such as age, income, daily internet usage, and more. The prediction model is built using logistic regression, a popular method for binary classification tasks.

## Overview
This project utilizes a dataset containing information about users and their behavior on a website. The goal is to predict whether a user clicked on an advertisement using a logistic regression model. Key features used in the model include:
- Daily Time Spent on Site
- Age
- Area Income
- Daily Internet Usage
- Gender

## Dataset
The dataset includes the following columns:
- Daily Time Spent on Site: Time spent by the user on the site in minutes.
- Age: Age of the user.
- Area Income: Average income of the geographical area of the user.
- Daily Internet Usage: Time spent by the user on the internet in minutes.
- Male: Gender of the user (1 if male, 0 if female).
- Clicked on Ad: Target variable (1 if clicked, 0 if not).

## Results
The logistic regression model provides an accuracy of 92.66% on the test dataset. This indicates that the model is fairly accurate in predicting whether a user will click on an ad based on the provided features.



# 2.Air Pollution Analysis
   
The notebook demonstrates data preprocessing, analysis, and visualization techniques, potentially using machine learning models to predict pollution levels or uncover trends.

## Project Overview

Air pollution is a critical environmental issue affecting public health and the climate. This project aims to analyze air pollution data, identifying key pollutants, trends over time, and potentially predicting pollution levels using machine learning techniques.

## Key Features:
Data Cleaning: Preprocessing of raw air pollution data, handling missing values, and correcting data formats.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizations of key pollutants, trends, and seasonal variations.
Machine Learning Models : Implementations of predictive models to forecast pollution levels.
Visualizations: Graphical representations of data including line charts, bar charts, and heatmaps to help identify trends and patterns.

## results
RMSE : 28.167864
Mean of Test Data : 96.041435
