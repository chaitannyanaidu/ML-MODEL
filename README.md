Ad Click Prediction Using Logistic Regression
# Ad Click Prediction Using Logistic Regression

This project is focused on predicting whether a user will click on an advertisement based on various user attributes such as age, income, daily internet usage, and more. The prediction model is built using logistic regression, a popular method for binary classification tasks.

## Overview
This project utilizes a dataset containing information about users and their behavior on a website. The goal is to predict whether a user clicked on an advertisement using a logistic regression model. Key features used in the model include:
- Daily Time Spent on Site
- Age
- Area Income
- Daily Internet Usage
- Gender

## Dataset
The dataset includes the following columns:
- Daily Time Spent on Site: Time spent by the user on the site in minutes.
- Age: Age of the user.
- Area Income: Average income of the geographical area of the user.
- Daily Internet Usage: Time spent by the user on the internet in minutes.
- Male: Gender of the user (1 if male, 0 if female).
- Clicked on Ad: Target variable (1 if clicked, 0 if not).

## Results
The logistic regression model provides an accuracy of 92.66% on the test dataset. This indicates that the model is fairly accurate in predicting whether a user will click on an ad based on the provided features.
